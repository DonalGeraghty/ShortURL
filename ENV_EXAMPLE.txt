# Google Cloud Authentication (Local Development Only)
# For production deployment on Google Cloud, this is not needed!

# Option 1: Service Account Key (for local development)
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=path/to/your/google-cloud-service-account.json

# Option 2: Use Google Cloud CLI instead (recommended)
# Run: gcloud auth application-default login
# This automatically sets up credentials for local development

# Note: When deployed on Google Cloud, the application automatically
# uses the service account credentials - no environment variables needed!
